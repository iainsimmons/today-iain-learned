Acupuncture was repeatedly recommended by my wife and my colleagues for any sort of pain or discomfort. So I went for the first time after tweaking a muscle in my neck and having pain radiating from my neck and shoulders for 2 days.

I was less concerned about the needles as I was about the massage therapy that came along with it, but I survived both, and even some TENS (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) through the needles (very interesting sensation).

Feeling a lot better since then, can even turn my head like a regular human!
